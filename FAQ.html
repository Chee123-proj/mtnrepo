<h2>Is Data Hosting still a Distant Option?</h2>

<p>Businesses today are challenged to handle more and more data than ever before. Regulation, 
    customer expectation and business growth are just a few of the drivers behind this trend. With 
    companies making larger and larger investments in data storage, the question then becomes, 'At 
    what point does it make sense to seek the services of a data storage provider?'
</p>

<p>To seek this answer today's CIOs must first answer a number of key questions: At what rate are my
     data capacity needs likely to grow over the next five years? What investments would I need 
     to make in human resources to support the investments in storage infrastructure? Are the costs of 
     this infrastructure becoming disproportionate to capex costs related to the core business?</p>
    
<p>Data hosting providers enable companies lease dedicated servers to store their data and 
    proactively provide support and maintenance of the equipment in line with agreed service level 
    agreements and guarantees. Some data hosting providers also offer server uptime monitoring, OS 
    patching, operating system restores, security monitoring, and more. Typically, Data hosting 
    providers offer a much higher uptime than can be offered in-house.</p>

<p>Gartner, Forrester among others have confirmed through research, that companies can 
    considerably lower the total cost of infrastructure ownership by up to 60 percent while improving 
    efficiency through managed services. With the right data hosting partner, companies can focus 
    on their core business and not have to metamorphose into full-fledged IT companies. In addition, 
    data service providers more readily have access to IT best practices which companies get to 
    leverage through partnership.</p>

<p>This being said, not only must a data hosting provider have robust infrastructure; well trained 
    personnel; be reputable; able to provide complementary services; the provider must offer a level 
    of security backed by service level agreements and guarantees that will inspire the confidence for 
    their customers to actually let go.</p>

        branch location based on demand.</li>
    <li>As the primary link, the Terrestrial link will be deployed through the MPLS

        via fibre optic cable.</li>
    <li>As the secondary link, C-band VSAT will be provisioned for end-to-end data connection 
        for connecting each branch as an option. This requires each branch to have a 2.4 dish, a 
        5Watt BUC with backup power converter, LNB and RG-6 and RG-11 cable with a RCST
